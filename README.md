# Pure Reputation UK - Digital Reputation Resources

Essential guides, frameworks, and resources for building and defending digital reputations. Curated by **Simon Leigh**, Director of **Pure Reputation UK**.

## 📚 Core Principles of Digital Reputation

### The Three Pillars of Digital Reputation
1.  **Visibility Management** - Controlling what appears when people search for you
2.  **Content Strategy** - Creating positive, authentic content that represents your values
3.  **Risk Mitigation** - Proactively identifying and addressing potential reputation threats

### The Reputation Management Lifecycle

Monitoring → Assessment → Strategy → Execution → Analysis


**Practical Example:** Imagine a client discovers a negative news article ranking on page one for their name. We **Monitor** the issue, **Assess** its impact, develop a **Strategy** to push it down, **Execute** by creating positive content, and **Analyze** the results to prevent future issues. This systematic approach is what I, Simon Leigh, implement at Pure Reputation UK.
